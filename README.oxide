This is a fork of the pq-sys crate: https://crates.io/pq-sys.
The canonical repo is at https://github.com/sgrif/pq-sys.
This fork is used in Omicron (https://github.com/oxide/omicron).

This fork exists to fix https://github.com/sgrif/pq-sys/issues/36.  As of this
writing, the upstream "pq-sys" repo does not appear to be actively maintained.
There are several pull requests open for over a year from folks trying to use
it.  Some of these have no feedback from the maintainer.  If our PR for
https://github.com/sgrif/pq-sys/issues/36 is accepted upstream and released to
crates.io, we should delete this fork and update Omicron.
